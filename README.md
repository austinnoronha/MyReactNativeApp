# Overview

This is a simple mobile application built with ReactNative and MUI Theme
It has 3 screens:

- SignIn Screen
- Home Screen
- Details Screen

I have tried to use simple building blocks with react-navigation and Stack.Navigator to control the flow of the screens.

** Note: This is just a begginers learning APP to undertand the Flow of screens and passing data between screens uni-directional via Navigation Options.

## The Learning

This App can be used to learn and build a Mobile Native Apps with ReactNative + Flex in CSS + MUI Theme.
It's a fun learning app wherein you will learn to create:
- Components
- Stack Navigation
- Simple Form and Error Handling
- Flex Styling & MUI Theme
- Navbar State Management

Note: you can use npx or yarn as your package manager, but I prefer ` yarn ` as its caches packages locally.

# App created with Create Expo CLI / Client

This project was bootstrapped with [EXPO - Create React Native App](hhttps://docs.expo.io/get-started/create-a-new-app/).

At this point we should have Expo CLI installed on our development machine and the Expo client on an iOS or Android physical device or emulator. If not, go back to the [Installation](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/) guide before proceeding.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
The Expo Client opens up with Metro Builder
You can open the mobile app in web browser or on the expo client

[Web Browser App runs on Port:19006](http://localhost:19006/)

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
